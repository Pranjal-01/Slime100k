# Simulating Slime Colonies

Slime molds, a fascinating type of microorganism found in the biosphere, exhibit intriguing behaviors despite their simplicity. These organisms leave behind pheromone trails as they move, a chemical signal that others in the colony instinctively follow. The pheromone trails, however, are not permanent; they evaporate after a certain period.

By simulating these simple rules—pheromone deposition, trail-following, and evaporation—across a colony of 100,000 entities, we can observe surprisingly complex emergent behavior. This complexity arises from the interaction of individual slimes, each following simple, local rules, leading to intricate and dynamic patterns at the colony level.
